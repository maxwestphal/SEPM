# SEPM: Statistical Evaluation of Prediction Models

This R package allows to conduct statistical inference (hypotheses
testing and construction of confidence/comparison regions) regarding the
unknown performances of multiple (machine-learned) prediction models.
The main goal is (approximately) control the type 1 error rate of the
employed statistical tests to obtain a reliable performance assessment.

## Installation

The package can be installed by using the R command

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/maxwestphal/SEPM")
```

## Usage

Several simulation studies and real data examples are described at
<https://maxwestphal.github.io/SEPM.PUB/>. The main goal of this package
is to ensure that these numerical experiments can be reproduced.

**This package is only roughly documented and will not be developed any
further!**
