#' Statistical Evaluation of Prediction Models (SEPM)
#'
#' The SEPM package allows to conduct statistical inference regarding the the performance of (machine learned) prediction models.
#' It has two main functionalities, which are briefly described below. Note that this is an early development version.
#'
#' @section Model selection:
#'
#' Select a (sub)set of models from the initially large set of initial candidate models.
#' This is usually done based on some prior information, in particular hold-out- or cross-validation estimates.
#'
#' @section Model evaluation:
#'
#' Given a collection of selected models, the goal is now to evaluate them on independent test data.
#' Besides performance estimation, simulataneous confidence regions and test decisions may also be obtained.
