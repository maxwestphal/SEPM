Description: This package allows to conduct statistical inference (hypotheses testing and 
    construction of confidence intervals) regarding the unknown performances of (machine-learned)
    prediction models. The main goal is (approximately) control the type 1 error rate of the employed
    statistical tests to obtain a reliable performance assessment.
