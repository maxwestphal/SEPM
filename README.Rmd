# SEPM: Statistical Evaluation of Prediction Models

This R package allows to conduct statistical inference (hypotheses testing and 
construction of confidence/comparison regions) regarding the unknown performances of multiple 
(machine-learned) prediction models. 
The main goal is (approximately) control the type 1 error rate of the employed
statistical tests to obtain a reliable performance assessment.

## Installation

The package can be installed by using the R command

```{r, include=T, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/maxwestphal/SEPM")
```

## Usage

Several simulation studies and real data examples are described at https://maxwestphal.github.io/SEPM.PUB/.
The main goal of this package is to ensure that these numerical experiments can be reproduced.

**This package is only roughly documented and will not be developed any further!**
