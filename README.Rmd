## Overview

This **R package** allows to conduct statistical inference (hypotheses testing and 
construction of confidence/comparison regions) regarding the unknown performances of multiple 
(machine-learned) prediction models. 

**NOTE: This package is no longer maintained!**


---

## Installation

This package can be installed from GitHub with the following command

```{r install, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/maxwestphal/SEPM")
```


---

## Details

Several simulation studies and real data examples are described at https://maxwestphal.github.io/SEPM.PUB/.

The main goal of this package is to ensure that these numerical experiments can be reproduced.
